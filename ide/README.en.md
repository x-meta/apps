# IDE
The integrated development environment of dynamic model can be used to edit and run the model, and the corresponding ide can be selected according to different occasions.

Each ide basically supports Chinese and English, but the model documents are generally Chinese, but basic programming should still be possible. If possible, please help us translate the document into English.

## thingexplorer
The classes in the model editor are introduced through Maven. Thingexplorer contains the most class libraries and several other ides. The other ides only refer to the class libraries that can run their own.

## web

## javafx
