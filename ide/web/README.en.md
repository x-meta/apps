The first time you can directly click the login button, a random password will be created, and then log in with this password.

## Limitations of Web Editor
That is, the limitation of running SWT on rap. For details, please refer to the official website of eclipse. Simply put, some SWT features and controls are not supported, such as styledtext cannot be used, so the code cannot be colored, etc. Xworker has been adapted, and basic editing and running are OK.

## Security
Because the server-side model can be modified, there are security risks, and login authentication needs to be set.
The priority of the following validation methods is loginlistener > weblogin action > default.

### Default
The default user name is admin, and the password is created randomly. The user name and password are set in_ Local.xworker.config.XWorkerConfig model.
If you forget your password, you can use the SWT editor to modify the model or modify the model file manually.

### Weblogin action model
If the local.xworker.config.WebLogin model exists, the model is used as an action to perform verification.
The parameters of the action are loginname and password, the type is string, and the return value is Boolean. True is returned after verification, otherwise false is returned.

### Checking in Java code
The java interface xworker.web.thingeeditor.loginlistener can be implemented and set.
```
import xworker.web.thingeditor.Login;
import xworker.web.thingeditor.LoginListener
LoginListener listener = new LoginListener(){
    public boolean login(String name, String password){
        //Perform verification
    }
}ï¼›
Login.loginListener = listener;
```
